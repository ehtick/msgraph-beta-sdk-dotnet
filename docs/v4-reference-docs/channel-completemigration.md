# channel: completeMigration

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Complete the message migration process by removing `migration mode` from a [channel](../resources/channel.md) in a team. `Migration mode` is a special state that prevents certain operations, like sending messages and adding members, during the data migration process.

After a **completeMigration** request is made, you cannot import additional messages into the team. You can add members to the team after the request returns a successful response.
