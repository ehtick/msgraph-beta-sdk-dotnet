|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not Supported.|
|Application|Not Supported.|

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /print/shares/{printerShareId}
GET /print/printers/{printerId}/shares/{printerShareId}
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports some of the OData query parameters including $select, $expand to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

e.g. 
```http
GET /print/printers/{id}?$select=id,displayName,capabilities
```

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.
## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [printerShare](../resources/printershare.md) object in the response body.
By default, the response will not contain [printerCapabilities](../resources/printerCapabilities.md). To get **printerCapabilities**, use the `$select` query parameter. 

## Example

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
