# Delete privilegedRoleAssignment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

>[!CAUTION]
>This version of the Privileged Identity Management (PIM) API for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles is deprecated and stopped returning data on May 31, 2021. Use the new [PIM v3 API for managing Azure AD roles](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagementv3-overview) or learn how to [migrate](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagement-root#migrate-from-pim-v2-to-pim-v3-apis).

Delete [privilegedRoleAssignment](../resources/privilegedroleassignment.md).
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

The requestor needs to have _Privileged Role Administrator_ role.
 

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Not supported. |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /privilegedRoleAssignments/{id}
```

Note that ``{id}`` is in the format of 'userId_roleId', where userId is the GUID string for Azure AD user id, and roleId is the GUID string for Azure administrator role id.

## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `204 No Content` response code. It does not return anything in the response body.

Note that the tenant needs to be registered to PIM. Otherwise, the HTTP 403 Forbidden status code will be returned.
## Example
##### Request

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

```http

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
