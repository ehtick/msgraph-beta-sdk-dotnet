# Remove member

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Remove a member from a group via the **members** navigation property. You can't remove a member from groups with dynamic memberships.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                             |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                          |
| Application                            | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To remove members from a role-assignable group, the calling user must also be assigned the _RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory_ permission.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /groups/{id}/members/{id}/$ref
```
> [!CAUTION]
> If `/$ref` is not appended to the request and the calling app has permissions to manage the member object type, the member object will also be deleted from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD); otherwise, a `403 Forbidden` error is returned. For example, an app with both *GroupMember.ReadWrite.All* and *User.ReadWrite.All* permissions will delete a user. You can restore specific objects through the [Restore deleted items API](directory-deleteditems-restore.md).
