# Grant an appRoleAssignment to a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Use this API to assign an app role to a user. To grant an app role assignment to a user, you need three identifiers:

- `principalId`: The `id` of the user to whom you are assigning the app role.
- `resourceId`: The `id` of the resource `servicePrincipal` that has defined the app role.
- `appRoleId`: The `id` of the `appRole` (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to the user.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/appRoleAssignments
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend creating app role assignments through the `appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal, instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

Here is an example of the request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "user_create_approleassignment"
}-->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/cde330e5-2150-4c11-9c5b-14bfdc948c79/appRoleAssignments
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "principalId": "cde330e5-2150-4c11-9c5b-14bfdc948c79",
  "resourceId": "8e881353-1735-45af-af21-ee1344582a4d",
  "appRoleId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var appRoleAssignment = new AppRoleAssignment
{
	PrincipalId = Guid.Parse("cde330e5-2150-4c11-9c5b-14bfdc948c79"),
	ResourceId = Guid.Parse("8e881353-1735-45af-af21-ee1344582a4d"),
	AppRoleId = Guid.Parse("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")
};

await graphClient.Users["{user-id}"].AppRoleAssignments
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(appRoleAssignment);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
