# event: cancel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

This action allows the organizer of a meeting to send a cancellation message and cancel the event. 

The action moves the event to the Deleted Items folder. The organizer can also cancel an occurrence of a recurring meeting 
by providing the occurrence event ID. An attendee calling this action gets an error (HTTP 400 Bad Request), with the following
error message:

"Your request can't be completed. You need to be an organizer to cancel a meeting."

This action differs from [Delete](event-delete.md) in that **Cancel** is available to only the organizer, and lets
the organizer send a custom message to the attendees about the cancellation.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
