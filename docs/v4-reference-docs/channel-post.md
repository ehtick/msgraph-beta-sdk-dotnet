# Create channel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [channel](../resources/channel.md) in a team, as specified in the request body. When you create a channel, the maximum length of the channel's `displayName` is 50 characters. This is the name that appears to the user in Microsoft Teams.

You can add a maximum of 200 members when you create a private channel.

> [!NOTE]
> Some special characters in the channel name will cause the [Get filesFolder](/graph/api/channel-get-filesfolder) API to return an error. For details, see [Known issues](/graph/known-issues#create-channel).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Channel.Create, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Channel.Create.Group*, Channel.Create, Teamwork.Migrate.All, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |


<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041-->


> **Note**:
> - Permissions marked with * use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).
> - Permissions marked with ** are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.
> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they are not a member of.

> **Note**: In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data imported
using Teamwork.Migrate.All and/or [migration APIs](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/import-messages/import-external-messages-to-teams).

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /teams/{team-id}/channels
```

## Request headers

| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required.  |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [channel](../resources/channel.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [channel](../resources/channel.md) object in the response body for a channel with a **membershipType** value of `standard` or `private`. For a channel with a **membershipType** value of `shared`, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code and a link to the [teamsAsyncOperation](../resources/teamsasyncoperation.md).

If the request is unsuccessful, this method returns a `400 Bad Request` response code. The following are common reasons for this response:

* **createdDateTime** is set in the future.
* **createdDateTime** is correctly specified but the **channelCreationMode** instance attribute is missing or set to an invalid value.
