# Get a site resource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve properties and relationships for a [site][] resource.
A **site** resource represents a team site in SharePoint.

[site]: ../resources/site.md

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## Get the tenant's root site

To access the root SharePoint site within a tenant:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /sites/root
GET /sites/contoso.sharepoint.com
```

## Access a site by server-relative URL

If you have the server-relative URL for a **site** resource, you can construct a request as follows:

```http
GET /sites/{hostname}:/{server-relative-path}
```

## Access a group team site

To access the team site for a group:

```http
GET /groups/{group-id}/sites/root
```

## Example

### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-site" } -->

```msgraph-interactive
GET /sites/{site-id}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var site = await graphClient.Sites["{site-id}"]
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
