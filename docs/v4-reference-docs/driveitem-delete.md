# Delete a DriveItem

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete a [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) by using its ID or path.
Note that deleting items using this method will move the items to the recycle bin instead of permanently deleting the item.

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## Example

Here is an example of how to call this API.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "delete-drive-item", "scopes": "files.readwrite" } -->

```http
DELETE /me/drive/items/{item-id}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

await graphClient.Me.Drive.Items["{driveItem-id}"]
	.Request()
	.DeleteAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
