# Update ipNamedlocation

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of an [ipNamedLocation](../resources/ipNamedLocation.md) object.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Policy.Read.All and Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Policy.Read.All and Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /identity/conditionalAccess/namedLocations/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

You must specify the **@odata.type** as `#microsoft.graph.ipNamedLocation`.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|displayName|String|Human-readable name of the location.|
|ipRanges|[ipRange](../resources/iprange.md) collection|List of IP address ranges in IPv4 CIDR format (1.2.3.4/32) or any allowable IPv6 format from IETF RFC5962.|
|isTrusted|Boolean|The value is `true` if this location is explicitly trusted.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. It does not return anything in the response body.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
