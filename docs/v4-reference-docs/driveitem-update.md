# Update DriveItem properties

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the metadata for a [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) by ID or path.

You can also use update to [move an item](driveitem-move.md) to another parent by updating the item's **parentReference** property.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}
PATCH /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
PATCH /me/drive/items/{item-id}
PATCH /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
PATCH /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
```

## Optional request headers

| Name          | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|:--------------|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| if-match      | String | If this request header is included and the eTag (or cTag) provided does not match the current eTag on the folder, a `412 Precondition Failed` response is returned. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for properties that should be updated.

Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.
For best performance your app should not include properties that haven't changed.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and updated [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) resource in the response body.

## Example

This example renames the DriveItem resource to "new-file-name.docx".


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "update-item" } -->

```http
PATCH /me/drive/items/{item-id}
Content-type: application/json

{
  "name": "new-file-name.docx"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var driveItem = new DriveItem
{
	Name = "new-file-name.docx"
};

await graphClient.Me.Drive.Items["{driveItem-id}"]
	.Request()
	.UpdateAsync(driveItem);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

If successful, this method returns an [driveItem][item-resource] resource in the response body.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem", "truncated": true } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "id": "01NKDM7HMOJTVYMDOSXFDK2QJDXCDI3WUK",
  "name": "new-file-name.docx",
