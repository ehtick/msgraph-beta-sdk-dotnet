# Add member to team
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Add a new [conversation member](../resources/conversationmember.md) to a [team](../resources/team.md).

> [!NOTE] 
> The **roles** property will be empty by default for all members. This property only contains additional qualifiers when relevant - for example, if the member has `owner` privileges, the roles property contains `owner` as one of the values. Similarly, if the member is a guest, the **roles** property contains `guest` as one of the values. A basic member should not have any values specified in the **roles** property.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)| TeamMember.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application| TeamMember.ReadWrite.All |

> [!NOTE]
> Using application permissions to [add guest members](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-guest-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) to a team is not supported.
