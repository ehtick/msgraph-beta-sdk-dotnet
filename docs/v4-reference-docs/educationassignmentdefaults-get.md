# Get educationAssignmentDefaults
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Read the properties and relationships of an [educationAssignmentDefaults](../resources/educationassignmentdefaults.md) object. 

These are the class-level assignment defaults respected by new [assignments](../resources/educationassignment.md) created in the class. Callers can continue to specify custom values on each **assignment** creation if they don't want the default behaviors. Only teachers can perform this operation.
