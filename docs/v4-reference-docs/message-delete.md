# Delete message

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Delete a message in the specified user's mailbox, or delete a relationship of the message.

For example, you can delete a specific [@-mention](../resources/mention.md) of the specified user in the message.

>**Note** You may not be able to delete items in the recoverable items deletions folder (represented by the [well-known folder name](../resources/mailfolder.md) `recoverableitemsdeletions`). See [Deleted item retention](/exchange/policy-and-compliance/recoverable-items-folder/recoverable-items-folder#deleted-item-retention) and [Clean up deleted items](/exchange/policy-and-compliance/recoverable-items-folder/clean-up-deleted-items) for more information.
