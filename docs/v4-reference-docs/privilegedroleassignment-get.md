>This version of the Privileged Identity Management (PIM) API for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles is deprecated and stopped returning data on May 31, 2021. Use the new [PIM v3 API for managing Azure AD roles](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagementv3-overview) or learn how to [migrate](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagement-root#migrate-from-pim-v2-to-pim-v3-apis).

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
