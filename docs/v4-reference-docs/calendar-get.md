# Get calendar

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get the properties and relationships of a [calendar](../resources/calendar.md) object. The calendar can be one for a [user](../resources/user.md), 
or the default calendar of a Microsoft 365 [group](../resources/group.md).

There are two scenarios where an app can get another user's calendar:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a calendar with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](/graph/outlook-get-shared-events-calendars).


## Permissions
Depending on the type of calendar that the event is in and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, one of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Calendar | Delegated (work or school account) | Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| user calendar | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite |
| group calendar | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All | Not supported. | Not supported. |

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
