# Create permissionGrantConditionSet in excludes collection of permissionGrantPolicy

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Add conditions under which a permission grant event is *excluded* in a permission grant policy. You do this by adding a [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) to the **excludes** collection of a  [permissionGrantPolicy](../resources/permissionGrantPolicy.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Policy.ReadWrite.PermissionGrant |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Policy.ReadWrite.PermissionGrant |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /policies/permissionGrantPolicies/{id}/excludes
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

In this example, *all* delegated permissions for Microsoft Graph (**appId** 00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000) are excluded from the permission grant policy.

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var permissionGrantConditionSet = new PermissionGrantConditionSet
{
	PermissionType = PermissionType.Delegated,
	ResourceApplication = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
};

await graphClient.Policies.PermissionGrantPolicies["{permissionGrantPolicy-id}"].Excludes
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(permissionGrantConditionSet);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
