# Create emailThreatSubmission
Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [emailThreatSubmission](../resources/security-emailthreatsubmission.md) object.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|ThreatSubmission.ReadWrite, ThreatSubmission.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported|
|Application|ThreatSubmission.ReadWrite.All|

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /security/threatSubmission/emailThreats
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of either an [emailContentThreatSubmission](../resources/security-emailcontentthreatsubmission.md) object or an [emailUrlThreatSubmission](../resources/security-emailurlthreatsubmission.md) object.

The **emailContentThreatSubmission** and **emailUrlThreatSubmission** resources are both subtypes of the **emailThreatSubmission** entity. Choose what to include in the request body based on the following:  
* If you want to create a submission with the email content itself, include an **emailContentThreatSubmission** object.
* If you want to create a submission with a URL that points to the email, include an **emailUrlThreatSubmission** object.

After the **emailContentThreatSubmission** or **emailUrlThreatSubmision** objects are created, the threat submission service just stores some metadata about the email. The email content is not stored. As a result, an **emailThreatSubmission** entity is created.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [emailThreatSubmission](../resources/security-emailthreatsubmission.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Email threat submission creation with messageUrl and emailUrlThreatSubmission type

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
