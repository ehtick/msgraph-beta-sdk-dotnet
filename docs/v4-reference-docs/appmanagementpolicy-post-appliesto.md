# Assign appliesTo

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Assign an [appManagementPolicy](../resources/appManagementPolicy.md) policy object to an application or service principal object. The application or service principal adopts this policy over the tenant-wide [tenantAppManagementPolicy](../resources/tenantappmanagementpolicy.md) setting. Only one policy object can be assigned to an application or service principal.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                                |
