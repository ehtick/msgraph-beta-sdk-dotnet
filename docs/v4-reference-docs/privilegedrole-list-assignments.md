Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

>[!CAUTION]
>This version of the Privileged Identity Management (PIM) API for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles is deprecated and stopped returning data on May 31, 2021. Use the new [PIM v3 API for managing Azure AD roles](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagementv3-overview) or learn how to [migrate](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagement-root#migrate-from-pim-v2-to-pim-v3-apis).

Retrieve a list of [privilegedRoleAssignment](../resources/privilegedroleassignment.md) objects that are associated with the role. Each [privilegedRoleAssignment](../resources/privilegedroleassignment.md) represents a role assignment to a user.

The requestor needs to have one of the following roles: _Privileged Role Administrator_, _Global Administrator_, _Security Administrator_, or _Security Reader_.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
