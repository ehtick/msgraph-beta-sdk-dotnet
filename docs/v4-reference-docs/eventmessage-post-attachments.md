# Add attachment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Use this API to create a new Attachment.

An attachment can be one of the following types:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource).
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource).
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceattachment.md) resource).

All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
resource.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
