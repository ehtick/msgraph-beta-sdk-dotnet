## Example
### Request
The following is an example of the request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "create_plannerbucket_from_planner"
}-->
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/planner/buckets
Content-type: application/json

{
  "name": "Advertising",

  "orderHint": " !"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var plannerBucket = new PlannerBucket
{
	Name = "Advertising",
	PlanId = "xqQg5FS2LkCp935s-FIFm2QAFkHM",

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
