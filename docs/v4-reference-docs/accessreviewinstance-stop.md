# Stop accessReviewInstance

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Stop a currently active [accessReviewInstance](../resources/accessreviewinstance.md). After the access review instance stops, the instance status will be `Completed`, the reviewers can no longer give input, and the access review decisions can be applied.

Stopping an instance will not effect future instances. To prevent a recurring access review from starting future instances, [update the schedule definition](accessreviewscheduledefinition-update.md) to change its scheduled end date.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application                            | AccessReview.ReadWrite.All |

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
