# List submission resources

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

List the resources associated with a submission. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

The [educationSubmissionResource](../resources/educationsubmissionresource.md) object is a wrapper around the actual resource object the student is working on. The wrapper also includes a pointer to the resources on the assignment if this was copied from the assignment during the assign process. These resources are the working copy of the assignment. The **submittedResources** are the resources that have officially been submitted to be graded.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
