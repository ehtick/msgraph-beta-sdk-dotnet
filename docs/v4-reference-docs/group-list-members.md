# List group members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a list of the group's direct members. A group can have users, contacts, devices, service principals, and other groups as members. This operation is not transitive.

When a group contains more than 100 members, Microsoft Graph returns a `@odata.nextLink` property in the response that contains a URL to the next page of results. If that property is present, continue making additional requests with the `@odata.nextLink` URL in each response, until all the results are returned, as described in [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

An attempt to filter by an OData cast that represents an unsupported member type returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Request_UnsupportedQuery` code.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                                              |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                                                           |
| Application                            | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

> **Note:** To list the members of a hidden membership group, the Member.Read.Hidden permission is required.


When an application queries a relationship that returns a directoryObject type collection, if it does not have permission to read a certain derived type (like device), members of that type are returned but with limited information. With this behaviour applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.** permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/members
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$count`, `$select`, `$search`, and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the group members that are users. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization    | Bearer {token}. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.

An attempt to filter by an OData cast that represents an unsupported member type returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Request_UnsupportedQuery` code. For example, `/groups/{id}}/members/microsoft.graph.group` when the group is a Microsoft 365 group will return this error, because Microsoft 365 groups cannot have other groups as members.
