# Get resource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve the binary data of a file or image [resource](../resources/onenoteresource.md) object.
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Notes.Read, Notes.ReadWrite, Notes.Read.All, Notes.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Notes.Read, Notes.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Notes.Read.All, Notes.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/onenote/resources/{id}/content
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/onenote/resources/{id}/content
GET /groups/{id}/onenote/resources/{id}/content
GET /sites/{id}/onenote/resources/{id}/content
```

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and the image or file binary data in the response body.

Note: Images won't render directly in a browser because they require authorization to retrieve them, like the rest of the page content.
## Example
##### Request
Here is an example of the request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_resource"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/onenote/resources/{id}/content
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var stream = await graphClient.Me.Onenote.Resources["{onenoteResource-id}"].Content
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
