# Create identityApiConnector

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [identityApiConnector](../resources/identityapiconnector.md) object.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | APIConnectors.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.  |
| Application                            | APIConnectors.ReadWrite.All |

The work or school account needs to belong to one of the following roles:

* Global administrator
* External Identity User Flow administrator

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

```http
POST /identity/apiConnectors
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description                 |
| :------------ | :-------------------------- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.   |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [identityApiConnector](../resources/identityapiconnector.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [identityApiConnector](../resources/identityapiconnector.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|displayName|String| The name of the API connector. |
|targetUrl|String| The URL of the API endpoint to call. |
|authenticationConfiguration|[apiAuthenticationConfigurationBase](../resources/apiauthenticationconfigurationbase.md)|The object which describes the authentication configuration details for calling the API. [Basic authentication](../resources/basicauthentication.md) and [PKCS 12 client certificate](../resources/pkcs12certificate.md) are supported.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [identityApiConnector](../resources/identityapiconnector.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create an API connector with basic authentication

#### Request

The following is an example of the request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "create_APIConnector_basic_auth"
}
-->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identity/apiConnectors
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "displayName":"Test API",
    "targetUrl":"https://someapi.com/api",
    "authenticationConfiguration": {
      "@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.basicAuthentication",
      "username":"<USERNAME>",
      "password":"<PASSWORD>"
    }
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var identityApiConnector = new IdentityApiConnector
{
	DisplayName = "Test API",
	TargetUrl = "https://someapi.com/api",
	AuthenticationConfiguration = new BasicAuthentication
	{
		Username = "<USERNAME>",
		Password = "<PASSWORD>"
	}
};

await graphClient.Identity.ApiConnectors
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(identityApiConnector);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

>**Note:** The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.

### Example 2: Create an API connector with client certificate authentication

#### Request

The following is an example of the request.

> **Note:** `authenticationConfiguration` in the request is of type [microsoft.graph.pkcs12certificate](../resources/pkcs12certificate.md), which represents the configuration of a certificate needed on upload or create.

        "password": "<password>"
    }
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var identityApiConnector = new IdentityApiConnector
{
	DisplayName = "Test API",
	TargetUrl = "https://someotherapi.com/api",
	AuthenticationConfiguration = new Pkcs12Certificate
	{
