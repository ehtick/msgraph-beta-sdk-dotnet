>[!CAUTION]
>This version of the access review API is deprecated and will stop returning data on May 19, 2023. Please use [access reviews API](/graph/api/resources/accessreviewsv2-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
In the Azure AD [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, list all the [programControl](../resources/programcontrol.md) objects, linked to a particular program.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
