# Delete channel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Delete the [channel](../resources/channel.md).

> **Note**: There is a known issue with application permissions and this API. For details, see the [known issues list](/graph/known-issues#application-permissions).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Channel.Delete.All, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |

> **Note**:
> - Permissions marked with * use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).
> - Permissions marked with ** are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.
