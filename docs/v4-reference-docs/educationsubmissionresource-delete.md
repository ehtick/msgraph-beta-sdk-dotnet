# Delete educationSubmissionResource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Delete an [educationSubmissionResource](../resources/educationsubmissionresource.md) from the submission. Only teachers and students can perform this operation.

If the resource was copied from the assignment, a new copy of the resource will be created after the current copy is deleted. This allows you to "reset" the resource to its original state. If the resource was not copied from the assignment but was added from the student, the resource is simply deleted.
