# List federatedIdentityCredentials
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a list of the [federatedIdentityCredential](../resources/federatedidentitycredential.md) objects and their properties.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) |  Application.ReadWrite.All |
|Application | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All |

> [!NOTE]
> The *Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy* permission allows an app to call `GET /applications` and `GET /servicePrincipals` to list all applications and service principals in the tenant. This scope of access has been allowed for the permission.
## HTTP request

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /applications/{id}/federatedIdentityCredentials
GET /applications(appId='{appId}')/federatedIdentityCredentials
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$filter` (`eq`) and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. For example, `/applications/{id}/federatedIdentityCredentials?$filter=subject eq 'value'`.

## Request headers
|Name|Description|

|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [federatedIdentityCredential](../resources/federatedidentitycredential.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples

-->
``` http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/bcd7c908-1c4d-4d48-93ee-ff38349a75c8/federatedIdentityCredentials/
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
