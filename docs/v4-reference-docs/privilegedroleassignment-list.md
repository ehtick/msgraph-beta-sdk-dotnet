>[!CAUTION]
>This version of the Privileged Identity Management (PIM) API for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles is deprecated and stopped returning data on May 31, 2021. Use the new [PIM v3 API for managing Azure AD roles](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagementv3-overview) or learn how to [migrate](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagement-root#migrate-from-pim-v2-to-pim-v3-apis).

Retrieve a list of [privilegedRoleAssignment](../resources/privilegedroleassignment.md) objects, which correspond to all role assignments for the organization.

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

The requestor needs to have one of the following roles: _Privileged Role Administrator_, _Global Administrator_, _Security Administrator_, or _Security Reader_. 

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
