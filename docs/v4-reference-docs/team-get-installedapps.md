Retrieve the [app](../resources/teamsappinstallation.md) installed in the specified [team](../resources/team.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
