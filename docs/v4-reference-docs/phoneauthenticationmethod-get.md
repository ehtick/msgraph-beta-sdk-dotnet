# Get phoneAuthenticationMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve a single [phoneAuthenticationMethod](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) object. This method is available only for standard Azure AD and B2B users, but not B2C users.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):
* Global administrator
* Global reader
* Privileged authentication administrator
* Authentication administrator (only sees masked phone numbers)

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /me/authentication/phoneMethods/{phoneMethodId}
GET /users/{userId | userPrincipalName}/authentication/phoneMethods/{phoneMethodId}
```
The value of `phoneMethodId` corresponding to the phoneType is one of the following:
+ `b6332ec1-7057-4abe-9331-3d72feddfe41` to retrieve the `alternateMobile` **phoneType**.
+ `e37fc753-ff3b-4958-9484-eaa9425c82bc` to retrieve the `office` **phoneType**.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
