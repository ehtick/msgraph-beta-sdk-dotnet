# Create taskTrigger

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [task trigger](../resources/printtasktrigger.md) on the specified [printer](../resources/printer.md). Currently, only **one** task trigger can be specified per printer, but this limit might be removed in the future. 

>**Note:** The appId used to generate an access token for creating a task trigger should be the same appId that was used to create the corresponding task definition.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

In addition to the following permissions, the user's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription. The signed in user must be a [Printer Administrator](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#printer-administrator).

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)| Printer.ReadWrite.All, Printer.FullControl.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not Supported.|
|Application|Not Supported.|

## HTTP request

```http
POST /print/printers/{id}/taskTriggers
```

## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type  | application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [printTaskTrigger](../resources/printtasktrigger.md) object. Supply a reference to a [printTaskDefinition](../resources/printtaskdefinition.md) by using the `@odata.bind` format, as shown in the following example.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [printTaskTrigger](../resources/printtasktrigger.md) in the response body.

## Example
### Request
The following is an example of the request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "create_printer_tasktrigger"

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/print/printers/ae63f617-4856-4b45-8ea9-69dfbeea230e/taskTriggers

}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var printTaskTrigger = new PrintTaskTrigger
{
	Event = PrintEvent.JobStarted,
	AdditionalData = new Dictionary<string, object>()
	{
		{"definition@odata.bind", "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/print/taskDefinitions/3203656e-6069-4e10-8147-d25290b00a3c"}
	}
};

await graphClient.Print.Printers["{printer-id}"].TaskTriggers
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(printTaskTrigger);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response
The following is an example of the response.
