# List contacts

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get contacts in the user's mailbox.

There are two scenarios where an app can get contacts in another user's contact folder:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a contact folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](/graph/outlook-get-shared-contacts-folders).


## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request

To get all the contacts in a user's default Contacts folder:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/contacts
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contacts
```

To get contacts in a specific folder in the user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/contactfolders/{Id}/contacts
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contactfolders/{id}/contacts

GET /me/contactFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/.../contacts
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contactFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/contacts
```
## Optional query parameters
You can use the `$filter` query parameter to filter contacts based on their email addresses:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
``` http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/contacts?$filter=emailAddresses/any(a:a/address eq 'garth@contoso.com')
```

Note that you can use `$filter`, `any`, and the `eq` operator on only the **address** sub-property of instances in an **emailAddresses** collection. That is, you cannot filter on the **name** or any other sub-property of an instance of **emailAddresses**, nor can you apply any other operator or function with `filter`, such as `ne`, `le`, and `startswith()`.

For general information on the `$filter` query parameter, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [contact](../resources/contact.md) objects in the response body.
## Example
##### Request
The following example gets the **displayName** and **emailAddresses** properties of the signed-in user's contacts.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "user_get_contacts"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/contacts?$select=displayName,emailAddresses
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var contacts = await graphClient.Me.Contacts
	.Request()
	.Select("displayName,emailAddresses")
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
