# Get authentication operation

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve the properties and relationships of an [operation](../resources/operation.md) object. Currently these operations are generated by initiating a password reset using the [reset password](authenticationmethod-resetpassword.md) method. An operation object tells the caller about the current state of that password reset operation. Possible states include:

* NotStarted
* Running
* Succeeded
* Failed

`Succeeded` and `Failed` are terminal states.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions acting on self (from least to most privileged) | Permissions acting on others (from least to most privileged)|
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read, UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. | Not supported. |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):

* Global administrator
* Global reader
* Privileged authentication administrator
* Authentication administrator

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
