# List group memberOf

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get groups and administrative units that the group is a direct member of.

This operation is not transitive. Unlike getting a user's Microsoft 365 groups, this returns all types of groups, not just Microsoft 365 groups.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                       |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                                    |
| Application                            | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/memberOf
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the groups the group is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization    | Bearer {token}. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |
