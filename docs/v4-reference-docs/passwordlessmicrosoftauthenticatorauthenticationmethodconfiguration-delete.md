Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Remove changes made to the [Microsoft Authenticator Phone Sign-in authentication method policy](../resources/passwordlessmicrosoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethodconfiguration.md) by reverting the policy to its default configuration.

> The Microsoft Authenticator Passwordless Phone Sign-in authentication method policy API is deprecated and stopped returning results on December 31, 2020. Please use the new [Microsoft Authenticator authentication method policy](../resources/microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration.md).
