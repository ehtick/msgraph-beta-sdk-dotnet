# Get userFlowLanguageConfiguration

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Read the properties and relationships of a [userFlowLanguageConfiguration](../resources/userflowlanguageconfiguration.md) object. These objects represent a language available in a user flow.

**Note:** To retrieve a language supported for customization, you must first enable language customization on your Azure AD B2C user flow. For more information, see [Update b2cIdentityUserFlow](../api/b2cidentityuserflow-update.md). Language customization is enabled by default in [Azure Active Directory user flows](../resources/b2xidentityuserflow.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)|IdentityUserFlow.Read.All, IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)| Not supported.|
|Application|IdentityUserFlow.Read.All, IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All|

The work or school account needs to belong to one of the following roles:

* Global administrator
* External Identity User Flow administrator

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
