# List manager

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Returns the user or organizational contact assigned as the user's manager. Optionally, you can expand the manager's chain up to the root node.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |


When an application queries a relationship that returns a directoryObject type collection, if it does not have permission to read a certain derived type (like device), members of that type are returned but with limited information. With this behaviour applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.** permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

## HTTP request

Get the manager:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/manager
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/manager
```
Get the management chain:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me?$expand=manager
GET /users?$expand=manager($levels=n)
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/?$expand=manager($levels=n)
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.  

>**Note:** 
> + The `n` value of `$levels` can be `max` (to return all managers) or a number between 1 and 1000.  
> + When the `$levels` parameter is not specified, only the immediate manager is returned.
> + You can specify `$select` inside `$expand` to select the individual manager's properties. The `$levels` parameter is required: `$expand=manager($levels=max;$select=id,displayName)`.

## Request headers

| Header       | Value|
|:-----------|:------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. Required when the request includes the `$count=true` query string. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Get manager

The following example shows a request to get the manager.

#### Request

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_manager_2"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/{id|userPrincipalName}/manager
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var directoryObject = await graphClient.Users["{user-id}"].Manager
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.user",
  "isCollection": false
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "id": "7d54cb02-aaa3-4016-9f9c-a4b49422dd9b",
  "displayName": "Sara Davis",
  "jobTitle": "Finance VP",
  "mail": "SaraD@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
  "userPrincipalName": "SaraD@contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
}
```

### Example 2: Get manager chain up to the root level

The following example shows a request to get the manager chain up to the root level. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$count=true` query string is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

#### Request



# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_transitive_managers"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me?$expand=manager($levels=max;$select=id,displayName)&$select=id,displayName&$count=true
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var queryOptions = new List<QueryOption>()
{
	new QueryOption("$count", "true")
};

var user = await graphClient.Me
	.Request( queryOptions )
	.Header("ConsistencyLevel","eventual")
	.Expand("manager($levels=max;$select=id,displayName)")
	.Select("id,displayName")
	.GetAsync();

```
