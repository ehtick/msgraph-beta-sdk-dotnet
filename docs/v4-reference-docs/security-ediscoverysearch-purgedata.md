> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Delete Microsoft Teams messages contained in a [eDiscovery search](../resources/security-ediscoverysearch.md). 

>**Note:** This request purges Teams data only. It does not purge other types of data such as mailbox items.

You can collect and purge the following categories of Teams content:
- **Teams 1:1 chats** - Chat messages, posts, and attachments shared in a Teams conversation between two people. Teams 1:1 chats are also called *conversations*.
- **Teams group chats** - Chat messages, posts, and attachments shared in a Teams conversation between three or more people. Also called *1:N* chats or *group conversations*.
- **Teams channels** - Chat messages, posts, replies, and attachments shared in a standard Teams channel.
- **Private channels** - Message posts, replies, and attachments shared in a private Teams channel.
- **Shared channels** - Message posts, replies, and attachments shared in a shared Teams channel.
