Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Removes an item from a [list][].

[list]: ../resources/list.md

## Permissions

To delete an item, the user must have granted the application write access to the item to be deleted.

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}/items/{item-id}
```

## Optional request headers

| Name       | Value | Description
|:-----------|:------|:--------------------------------------------------------
| _if-match_ | etag  | If this request header is included and the eTag provided does not match the current tag on the item, a `412 Precondition Failed` response is returned and the item will not be deleted.

## Request body

Do not supply a request body with this method.

## Example


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "delete-item", "scopes": "files.readwrite" } -->

```http
DELETE https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}/items/{item-id}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

await graphClient.Sites["{site-id}"].Lists["{list-id}"].Items["{listItem-id}"]
	.Request()
	.DeleteAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
