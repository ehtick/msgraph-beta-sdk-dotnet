# CloudPcOnPremisesConnection: runHealthChecks

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Run health checks on the [cloudPcOnPremisesConnection](../resources/cloudpconpremisesconnection.md) object.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **On-premises network connection** has been renamed as **Azure network connection**. **cloudPcOnPremisesConnection** objects here are equivalent to **Azure network connection** for the Cloud PC product.

This will trigger a new health check for this [cloudPcOnPremisesConnection](../resources/cloudpconpremisesconnection.md) object and change the healthCheckStatus and [healthCheckStatusDetails](../resources/cloudpconpremisesconnectionstatusdetails.md) properties when check finished.
