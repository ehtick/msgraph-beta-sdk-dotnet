# sourceCollection: estimateStatistics

Namespace: microsoft.graph.ediscovery

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Run an estimate of the number of emails and documents in the source collection. To learn more about source collections (also known as searches in eDiscovery), see [Collect data for a case in Advanced eDiscovery](/microsoft-365/compliance/collecting-data-for-ediscovery).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|eDiscovery.Read.All, eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|Not supported.|

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

``` http
POST /compliance/ediscovery/cases/{caseId}/sourceCollections/{sourceCollectionId}/estimateStatistics
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If the estimate is started successfully, this action returns a `202 Accepted` response code. The response will also contain a `Location` header, which contains the location of the [estimateStatisticsOperation](../resources/ediscovery-estimatestatisticsoperation.md) that was created to handle the estimate. Check the status of the estimate operation by making a GET request to the location, when successfully completed, the [status](../resources/ediscovery-caseoperation.md#caseoperationstatus-values) will change to `succeeded`.

## Examples

### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "sourcecollection_estimatestatistics"
}
-->

``` http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/compliance/ediscovery/cases/{caseId}/sourceCollections/{sourceCollectionId}/estimateStatistics
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

await graphClient.Compliance.Ediscovery.Cases["{ediscovery.case-id}"].SourceCollections["{ediscovery.sourceCollection-id}"]
	.EstimateStatistics()
	.Request()
	.PostAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
