Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

In [Azure AD Entitlement Management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), retrieve a list of [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md) objects filtered on the signed-in user.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|Not supported.|

## HTTP request

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|on|accessPackageFilterByCurrentUserOptions|The list of current user options that can be used to filter on the access packages list. The allowed value is `allowedRequestor`.|

- `allowedRequestor` is used to get the `accessPackage` objects for which the signed-in user is allowed to submit access requests. The resulting list includes all access packages that can be requested by the caller across all catalogs.

## Request headers

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md) collection in the response body.

## Examples
The following example gets the access packages that can be requested by the signed-in user.

### Request

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "accesspackage_filterByCurrentUser"
}
-->
``` http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackages/filterByCurrentUser(on='allowedRequestor')
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var filterByCurrentUser = await graphClient.IdentityGovernance.EntitlementManagement.AccessPackages
	.FilterByCurrentUser(AccessPackageFilterByCurrentUserOptions.AllowedRequestor)

	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
