# accessReviewStage: stop
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Stop an [access review stage](../resources/accessReviewStage.md) that is `inProgress`. After the access review stage stops, the stage **status** will be `Completed` and the reviewers can no longer give input. If there are subsequent stages that depend on the completed stage, the next stage will be created. 

The [accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem](../resources/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) objects will always reflect the last decisions recorded across all stages at that given time, regardless of the status of the stages.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
