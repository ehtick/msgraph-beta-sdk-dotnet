# Delete timeOffReason

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Mark a [timeOffReason](../resources/timeoffreason.md) as inactive by setting the **isActive** property. Every team must include at least one **timeOffReason**.

This method does not remove the specified **timeOffReason** instance. [timeOffItem](../resources/timeoffitem.md) instances that have been assigned this reason remain assigned to this reason.
