# Assign appliesTo

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!CAUTION]
> The featureRolloutPolicy API moved from /directory/featureRolloutPolicies to **/policies/featureRolloutPolicies** on March 5, 2021. The previous /directory/featureRolloutPolicies endpoint stopped returning returning data after June 30, 2021.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Add an appliesTo on a [featureRolloutPolicy](../resources/featurerolloutpolicy.md) object to specify the [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) to which the [featureRolloutPolicy](../resources/featurerolloutpolicy.md) should be applied.

## Examples

### Request

The following is an example of the request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "create_directoryobject_from_featurerolloutpolicy_policies"
}-->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/policies/featureRolloutPolicies/{id}/appliesTo/$ref
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@odata.id": " https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/directoryObjects/2441b489-4f12-4882-b039-8f6006bd66da"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var directoryObject = new DirectoryObject
{
	Id = "2441b489-4f12-4882-b039-8f6006bd66da"
};

await graphClient.Policies.FeatureRolloutPolicies["{featureRolloutPolicy-id}"].AppliesTo.References

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
