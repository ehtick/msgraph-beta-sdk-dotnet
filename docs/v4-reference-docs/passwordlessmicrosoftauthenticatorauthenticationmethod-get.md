# Get passwordlessMicrosoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethod (deprecated)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve a user's single [Microsoft Authenticator Passwordless Phone Sign-in method](../resources/passwordlessmicrosoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod.md) object.

> [!CAUTION]
> The Microsoft Authenticator Passwordless Phone Sign-in method API is deprecated and will stop returning results on December 31, 2020. Please use the new [Microsoft Authenticator Authentication Method](../resources/microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethod.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):
* Global administrator
* Global reader
* Privileged authentication administrator
* Authentication administrator (only sees masked phone numbers)
