>[!CAUTION]
>Existing apps that use this feature with [baseTask](/graph/api/resources/basetask?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [baseTaskList](/graph/api/resources/basetasklist?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) should be updated, as the to-do API set built on these resources is deprecated as of May 31, 2022. That API set will stop returning data on August 31, 2022. Please use the API set built on [todoTask](/graph/api/resources/todotask?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). 
Subscribes a listener application to receive change notifications when the requested type of changes occur to the specified resource in Microsoft Graph.

See the table in the [Permissions](#permissions) section for the list of resources that support subscribing to change notifications.

Some resources support the option to include encrypted resource data in change notifications. These resources include [chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md), [contact](../resources/contact.md), [event](../resources/event.md), [message](../resources/message.md), [onlineMeetings](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) and [presence](../resources/presence.md). For more information, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) and [Change notifications for Outlook resources in Microsoft Graph](/graph/outlook-change-notifications-overview).

## Permissions

Creating a subscription requires read permission to the resource. For example, to get change notifications on messages, your app needs the Mail.Read permission. 

Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing the permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

> **Note**: 
>
> Due to security restrictions, Microsoft Graph subscriptions do not support write access permissions when only read access permissions are needed.
>
> Some resources support change notifications in multiple scenarios, each of which may require different permissions. In those cases, use the resource path to differentiate the scenarios.
>
> Permissions marked with * use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

### chatMessage

**chatMessage** subscriptions can be specified to include resource data. If specified to include resource data (**includeResourceData** set to `true`), [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) is required. The subscription creation fails if an [encryptionCertificate](/graph/api/resources/subscription) isn't specified for such subscriptions. Before you can create a **chatMessage** subscription with application permissions, you might need to request access. For details, see [Protected APIs in Microsoft Teams](/graph/teams-protected-apis).

You must use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values in **chatMessage** **messageType** [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `systemEventMessage` for `/teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages` and `/chats/{id}/messages` resource.

> [!NOTE]
>`/teams/getAllMessages`, `/chats/getAllMessages`, `/me/chats/getAllMessages`, `/users/{id}/chats/getAllMessages`, and `/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats/getAllMessages` 
> have [licensing and payment requirements](/graph/teams-licenses).
> `/teams/getAllMessages` and `/chats/getAllMessages` support both `model=A` and `model=B` query parameters,
> `/me/chats/getAllMessages`, `/users/{id}/chats/getAllMessages`, and `/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats/getAllMessages`  support only `model=B`.
> If no model is specified, [evaluation mode](/graph/teams-licenses#evaluation-mode-default-requirements) will be used.

### conversationMember
**conversationMember** subscriptions can be specified to include resource data. If specified to include resource data (**includeResourceData** set to `true`), [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) is required. The subscription creation fails if an [encryptionCertificate](/graph/api/resources/subscription) isn't specified.

> [!NOTE]
>`/teams/getAllMembers`, `/chats/getAllMembers`, and `/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats/getAllMembers ` have [licensing and payment requirements](/graph/teams-licenses).
> `/teams/getAllMembers` and `/chats/getAllMembers` support both `model=A` and `model=B` query parameters. `/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats/getAllMembers` supports only `model=B`.
> If no model is specified, [evaluation mode](/graph/teams-licenses#evaluation-mode-default-requirements) will be used.

### team, channel, and chat
**team**, **channel**, and **chat** subscriptions can be specified to include resource data. If specified to include resource data (**includeResourceData** set to `true`), [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) is required. The subscription creation fails if an [encryptionCertificate](/graph/api/resources/subscription) isn't specified.

> [!NOTE]
>`/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats` has [licensing and payment requirements](/graph/teams-licenses), specifically supporting only `model=B`.
> If no model is specified, [evaluation mode](/graph/teams-licenses#evaluation-mode-default-requirements) will be used.


#### Request example

Specify the `model` query parameter in the **resource** property in the request body.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-type: application/json

{
   "changeType": "created",
   "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/send/myNotifyClient",
   "resource": "chats/getAllMessages?model=A",
   "expirationDateTime":"2016-11-20T18:23:45.9356913Z",
   "clientState": "secretClientValue",
   "latestSupportedTlsVersion": "v1_2"
}
```

### driveItem

Additional limitations apply for subscriptions on OneDrive items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions.

On a personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Change notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other **driveItem** instances in its hierarchy. You cannot subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that are not folders, such as individual files.

OneDrive for Business and SharePoint support sending your application notifications of security events that occur on a **driveItem**. To subscribe to these events, add the `prefer:includesecuritywebhooks` header to your request to create a subscription. After the subscription is created, you will receive notifications when the permissions on an item change. This header is applicable to SharePoint and OneDrive for Business but not consumer OneDrive accounts.

### contact, event, and message

You can subscribe to changes in Outlook **contact**, **event**, or **message** resources and optionally specify in the POST request payload whether to include encrypted resource data in notifications.

Creating and managing (getting, updating, and deleting) a subscription requires a read scope to the resource. For example, to get change notifications on messages, your app needs the Mail.Read permission. Outlook change notifications support delegated and application permission scopes. Note the following limitations:

- Delegated permission supports subscribing to items in folders in only the signed-in user's mailbox. For example, you cannot use the delegated permission Calendars.Read to subscribe to events in another user’s mailbox.
- To subscribe to change notifications of Outlook contacts, events, or messages in _shared or delegated_ folders:

  - Use the corresponding application permission to subscribe to changes of items in a folder or mailbox of _any_ user in the tenant.
  - Do not use the Outlook sharing permissions (Contacts.Read.Shared, Calendars.Read.Shared, Mail.Read.Shared, and their read/write counterparts), as they do **not** support subscribing to change notifications on items in shared or delegated folders.
### onlineMeetings, presence

Subscriptions on **onlineMeetings** and **presence** require the **encryptionCertificate** and **encryptionCertificateId** property when [creating a subscription](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data#creating-a-subscription) for notifications with encrypted resource data. For more information, see [setting up change notifications to include resource data](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data).
For details about online meeting subscriptions, see [Get change notifications for online meetings](/graph/changenotifications-for-onlinemeeting).

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

The following example shows the response. 

>**Note:** The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.

```

#### Notification endpoint validation

The subscription notification endpoint (specified in the **notificationUrl** property) must be capable of responding to a validation request as described in [Set up notifications for changes in user data](/graph/webhooks#notification-endpoint-validation). If validation fails, the request to create the subscription returns a 400 Bad Request error.
