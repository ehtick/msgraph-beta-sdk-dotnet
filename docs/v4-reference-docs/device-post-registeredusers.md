The calling user must also be in one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference): *Global Administrator*, *Intune Administrator*, or *Windows 365 Administrator*.

```
## Request headers

| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) object.

## Response

## Example
##### Request

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
