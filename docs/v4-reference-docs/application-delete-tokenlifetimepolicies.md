# Remove tokenLifetimePolicy

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Remove a [tokenLifetimePolicy](../resources/tokenlifetimepolicy.md) from an [application](../resources/application.md) or [servicePrincipal](../resources/servicePrincipal.md).

## Permissions

One of the following sets of permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Policy.Read.All and Application.ReadWrite.All, Policy.ReadWrite.ApplicationConfiguration and Application.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Policy.Read.All and Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Policy.Read.All and Application.ReadWrite.All, Policy.ReadWrite.ApplicationConfiguration and Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Policy.ReadWrite.ApplicationConfiguration and Application.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

Token lifetime policies can be assigned to both applications and service principals.

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
